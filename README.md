# CODSOFT Internship Experience

Welcome to the CODSOFT Internship Experience repository! This repository contains the culmination of my internship journey, where I've explored and applied my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create some cool projects. Throughout this internship, I've had the opportunity to work on a calculator, a to-do list application, and a portfolio website.
